## SKE48 Matsui Jurina - Solo song MV filming coverage

For the past 10 years, there are few idols who have received more misunderstanding and prejudice than Matsui Jurina. She is said to be too pure in her words and actions, which is both a blessing and a curse. Even so, no matter what happens, Jurina is Jurina. We are the blessed witness to the rare story of Matsui Jurina.

### Ho~! Yahho~!

**-- This song has a pretty adult feel to it, doesn't it?**

J: It's a song about coincidentally meeting an ex-boyfriend, and then telling him "I don't know anything about you. Who were you again?". It's somewhat devilish. In my case, I would have been "Chochocho, it's been a while~" (laughs)

**-- "Akai Pin Heel to Professor" had a "small devil" feel to it didn't it?**

J: It's changed from a "small devil" to a "devil" (laughs).

**-- Are there elements like that within you, Jurina-san?**

J: There are. During a live performance where we go down to the audience, I'd put my arms over fans' shoulders. Because regardless of whether they're male or female, I just went "YAY!" and did it, the staff gave me a talking to about it (laughs). The fans I did that to went "KYA~".

**-- I'm sure they did!**

J: It's a different kind of approach from Suda (Akari)-chan. In my case, it's kind of a boyish feel. I didn't care if they were my own fans or not, I ended up putting my arms over their shoulders. Anyone's OK. We are ONE!

**-- This song screams "Matsui Jurina" on full throttle doesn't it?**

J: Today I'm by myself, so I feel like, "let's go for it!" (laughs). Like, "HO~! YAHHO~!". The only thing is I'm dancing for the first time in a while, so it's a bit tough. For the set and costumes to be prepared solely for myself, isn't it luxurious? I haven't had a solo MV since "Glory days". It's a first for a new song!

**-- Now that I think about it, there wasn't one for Akapin either.**

J: I was quite touched. Today, it might appear like I'm doing it smoothly, but the truth is I'm very moved. But actually, the thing is I have somewhat complicated feelings about it too. When I heard about the solo song, that was also when I was told I was being dropped from senbatsu. It was sad after all to break my streak of being in every senbatsu since debut, but rather than being depressed about it, I felt like it was a good thing that a different member could take the spot. I think I do hope for SKE48 to be like that.

**-- You mean, "SKE48 is more than just Jurina-san and Suda-san!", something like that?**

J: Yes. I think it would be great to have one more person with an interesting personality. Tanokin Trio (trans note: a famous comedy act)? Nah, like the Three Musketeers (laughs).

**-- The rest of the interview will be in the February edition of BUBKA!**
